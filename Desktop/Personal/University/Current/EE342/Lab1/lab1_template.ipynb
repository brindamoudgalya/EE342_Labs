    "**Overview**\n",
    "The purpose of this lab is to familiarize you with constructing and processing discrete-time sound signals. You will learn how to synthesize music notes and play them. You will concatenate a series of music notes into a small music piece, add volume variation to the music piece, overlap the adjacent notes to further make the music smoother and more realistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this process, you will learn to perform the following sound synthesis tasks:\n",
    "- Generating musical notes\n",
    "- Improving the quality of the generated sound\n",
    "- Overlapping notes"
